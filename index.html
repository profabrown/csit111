        <h2>Group Activity Instructions: Update an Adventure Game</h2>

        <p>You will be working in groups of 2-3 to expand and enhance the provided adventure game. The goal of
            this activity is for you to analyze the existing code and plan how you will add at least one more choice for
            the player. Additionally, you must incorporate both a <b>while loop</b> and a <b>for loop</b> somewhere in
            the game. </p>

        <p>First things first:</p>

        <h3>Examine the Provided Code</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Read through the program</b> (Link: <a href="adventureActivity.py">adventureActivity.py)</a><br>
                Familiarize yourself with how the game works by reading the entire
                code. Explain it outloud to each other so <b>everyone</b> in the group has a full understanding.
                <br><br>Pay close attention to the parts where the player makes choices, such as choosing to go left or
                right and deciding whether to fight or run.
            </li>
            <li><b>Understanding the random function:</b><br>
                The <code>random.randint(a, b)</code> function generates a random integer between <code>a</code> and
                <code>b</code>. In the game this is used to simulate dice rolls for both the player and the wolf. When
                the player fights the wolf, both the player and the wolf roll a number between 1 and 6. Whoever rolls
                the higher number wins.
                <br><br>

                Think about how you might use randomness in your own choices or encounters (e.g., additional dice rolls,
                varying treasure amounts, varying paths to travel).
            </li>

        </ol>


        <h3>Plan New Choices</h3>
        <p>In your group, come up with <b>at least one new scenario or choice</b> to add to the game. Be creative! Here
            are
            a few ideas to get you started:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Another fork in the road where different dangers await.</li>
            <li>Finding an item (e.g., a sword or potion) that can help in fights (add +1 to a dice roll, etc.)</li>
            <li>Encountering another character who offers a deal or a challenge.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Incorporate a While Loop and a For Loop</h3>
        <p>Your group also needs to incorporate both a <b>while loop</b> and a <b>for loop</b> into your game. Here are
            some
            ideas for how to use each:</p>

        <h4>While Loop Ideas:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>A loop that repeats until the player finds treasure or encounters a specific event.</li>
            <li>A loop that allows the player to keep making decisions until they reach a certain goal.</li>
            <li>A loop that asks the player to keep rolling dice until they either win or lose a fight.</li>
        </ul>


        <h4>For Loop Ideas:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A loop that repeats for a set number of turns (e.g., rolling the dice three times to see if the player
                can defeat the enemy - accumulator).</li>
            <li>A loop that goes through a list of obstacles or enemies that the player must face one by one.</li>
            <li>A loop to simulate repeated attempts to search for treasure or gather supplies.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Build Your Adventure World</h3>
        <p>Your group is free to design your game world however you like, using the provided code as a foundation. Think
            about
            what kind of adventure your players will go on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Whatâ€™s the main objective? Is it just to find treasure, or something more?</li>
            <li>What kinds of characters, challenges, and treasures will the players encounter?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Implement and Test</h3>
        <p>Once you have planned your new choices and loops, implement them in the code. Test the game by playing
            through it with different choices and scenarios. Debug as needed to ensure the game works as expected.</p>

        <h2>Deliverable Requirements</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>At least <b>one</b> new player choice in the game.</li>
            <li>At least one <b>while loop</b> and one <b>for loop</b> incorporated that makes sense for your code.</li>
            <li>Appropriate code comments to explain logic and changes made. </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Submission Requirements</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Hopefully, a working adventure game that reflects your group's creative world and objectives. (.py file)
            </li>
            <li>Reflection comment in your individual Brightspce submisison that includes links to any resources used
                and an explanation of how your group used them or what was learned from them.</li>
        </ol>
